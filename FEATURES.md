The main page presents the features of Crono in a navigation bar, which contains Home, Calendar, Chat, About, and change Theme shortcuts. There's also a Privacy Policy to insure our respect with the users.
We also present some characteristics of the code *per si* like the percentage of **Javascript**, **CSS** and **HTML**.
With the cup of coffee, we recommend you the nearests places of you for taking a good coffee.

# Calendar
----------
The calendar provides you an easy way to create and edit your tasks, just try it clicking on a day or task :+1:. You can organize your tasks by groups, determined by your groups in **Gmail**, set an image to illustrate the event and determine if it is Devlopping, Done, To Do etc. Sadly, you can not edit your **Facebook** events.

# Chat
-------
You can chat with your friends to decide what the best day for ending a task or determinate its deadline.
Also, if you are not the typing guy type, you can just click on the microphone logo and say what you want!
Send Emoji's to demonstrate how cute :heart_eyes: you are and send youtube links through the chat, we render it for you.
